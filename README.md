# Sorting-And-Searching-Algorithms
A collection of sorting and searching algorithms implemented in Python.

## Bubble Sort

Worst Case Performance: O(n^2) comparisons + O(n^2 swaps)
Best Case Performance: O(n) comparisons + O(1) swaps.
Average Performance: O(n^2) comparisons + O(n^2 swaps)

Due to its comparatively awful performances, bubble sort is a fairly impractical choice for sorting. Even on the best
case scenarios, Insertion Sort still outperforms Bubble Sort due to its low number of swaps on mostly sorted lists.

Cocktail Shaker Sort is a variation of this algorithm which sorts from either end.
